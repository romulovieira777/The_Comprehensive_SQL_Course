Note On String and Numerical Values

Unlike numerical values, string values must be enclosed in single quotes.

This is also the case when referencing a string value in a condition or clause. You will see examples of this throughout the course.

In the next lecture we are inserting values into a table and you should note that all string values will be enclosed in single quotes.
Numerical values do not need to be enclosed in single quotes unless they are stored as strings.
