Section Overview

This section will focus on SET Operators. We have already covered how to join tables together based on relationships
between these tables and now SET Operators will show you how to combine the result of multiple queries into a single set

After completing this section you will learn about:

    - UNION and UNION ALL
    - INTERSECT
    - MINUS

We will round this section off with a quiz.
