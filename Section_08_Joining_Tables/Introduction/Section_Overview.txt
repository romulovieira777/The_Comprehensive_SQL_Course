Section Overview

This is arguably one of the most important sections of this course.

Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns between the tables. For example if two tables have an 
associated field (e.g. Customer ID) then a join operation can be used to combine rows from both tables.

The join operation is a fundamental part of relational databases.

    - The difference between inner, left, right and full outer joins

    - How to combine columns from multiple tables using joins

We will round off the section with some practical assignment questions. It is crucial that you have a sound understanding of joins so please 
ensure you are comfortable with this section before moving on as it is one of the most important aspects of relational databases and SQL.
